"""Per-user trading engines (multi-tenant orchestration).

Each licensed user gets their OWN :class:`TradingEngine` instance, built from a
copy of the global env settings with that user's decrypted Binance keys and
their persisted per-user settings overrides layered on top. The AI/LLM key is
app-wide (operator env), never per-user. Engines are cached in memory and
hydrated lazily on first use, and rebuilt when a user changes their keys or
settings.

Security: a user's exchange secrets are only ever held decrypted inside their
own engine's Settings object in memory; they are stored on disk encrypted
(Fernet, keyed off SECRET_KEY) and never logged.
