"""Learning / training: optimise strategy parameters from historical data.

This is how you "teach" Tranding-track: give it a symbol + strategy, and it
searches the parameter space by backtesting every combination on real candles,
then reports the best-performing configuration (and can save it as the active
strategy config). This is a transparent, deterministic optimiser — no black box.
