"""Simple event-driven backtester for the built-in strategies.

Realism model:
- Entries/exits fill on the NEXT bar's open (no look-ahead: you can't trade on a
  bar's close using a signal computed from that same close).
- A per-side fee (taker by default) is charged on entry and exit.
- Slippage widens the fill against you (buy fills higher, sell fills lower),
  approximating spread + market impact. Backtest/training numbers are therefore
  conservative rather than optimistic.

    trades rather than an idealised buy-and-hold-until-sell-signal run. They are
    resting orders, so they fill INTRABAR on the triggering bar (using its high/
    low), not at the next open. All default to 0 (disabled) to preserve the
    plain signal-only behaviour. When both a stop and target are touched on the
    same bar we assume the stop filled first (worst case). A gap through a level
    fills at that bar's open; stop fills also take adverse slippage (they are
    market orders) while take-profit limit fills do not.
